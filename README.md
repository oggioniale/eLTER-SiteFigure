eLTER_siteFigure function
======================

eLTER sites managers often want to create figure of the site boundaries.

These R functions allow to create this based on the geographic boundaries entered in DEIMS-SDR as a polygon.

The figure is created with a base map Open Street Map (OSM) (© [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) contributors), site boundaries, and title of the site, a resolution of 400px and an PNG extension suitable for both website and publication.

## Using:
For all eLTER sites the function 
```R
fProduceMapOfSiteFromDEIMS("https://deims.org/1c9f9148-e8dc-4b67-ac13-ce387c5a6a2f")
``` 
is without country inset map:
...

For LTER-Italy sites is possible use also this function 
```R 
fProduceMapOfSite("https://deims.org/769556a6-0ee6-46a9-acbb-a1f2d51c07e8")
``` 
is also accompanied by a evaluation of the country and the figure presents a inset map with relative position of the site in the country:
