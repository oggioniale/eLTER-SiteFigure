# eLTER Site Figure
eLTER sites managers often want to create figure of the site boundaries.

These R functions allow to create this based on the geographic boundaries entered in DEIMS-SDR as a polygon.

The figure is created with Open Street Map (OSM) base map, site boundaries, and title of the site, a resolution of 400px and an PNG extension suitable for both website and publication.
