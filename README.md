eLTER Site Figure
======================

## Description 
eLTER sites managers often want to create figure of the site boundaries.

These R functions allow to create this based on the geographic boundaries entered in DEIMS-SDR as a polygon.

The figure is created with Open Street Map (OSM) base map, site boundaries, and title of the site, a resolution of 400px and an PNG extension suitable for both website and publication.

For LTER-Italy sites the function 
```R 
fProduceMapOfSite
``` 
is also accompanied by a evaluation of the country and the figure presents a inset map with relative position of the site in the country:

```R
fProduceMapOfSiteFromDEIMS
``` 
is without country inset map:
